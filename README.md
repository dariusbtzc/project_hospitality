# Project Hospitality

This project aims to help two hotels — namely Resort Hotel and City Hotel — gain a competitive edge in the hotel industry and maximise their revenue by answering the following business questions:

* What are the important customer segments?
* Can we predict booking cancellations?
* What are the key features involved in booking cancellations?
